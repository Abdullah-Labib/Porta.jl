# Geometrizer
Geometrize the quantum!

This project aims to help with Eric Weinstein's Graph, Wall, Tome (GWT) assignment. Please orient yourself through [The Portal](https://theportal.wiki/wiki/Main_Page)! The ideal state would be a tool that you can use for visualizing and inspecting the equations on the wall, located at [Stony Brook University](http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~tony/scgp/wall-story/wall-story.html).

## TODO
- Complex numbers
- Spheres
- Quaternions
- The Hopf fibration
- Maxwell's equations
