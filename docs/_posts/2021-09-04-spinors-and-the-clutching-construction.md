# What's the connection between spinors and the clutching construction?

### Why should we care?
Today, we're going to talk about an important mathematical object: spinors. It determines the properties of atoms in the form of electron shells. It's responsible for the stability of matter. Without it, the periodic table wouldn't exist. And also quarks which make up protons and neutrons.

### Spinors in the pop culture
It's the idea behind Chrostopher Nolan's Tenet. Remember? Similar pairs of objects, one traveling forward through time, the other one going backwards! It's also closely related to the Mololith, in Sir Roger Penrose's favorite movie: A Space Odyssey: 2001. Spinors have been much like the Monolith for almost a century. When Paul Dirac put in order the discoveries of quantum physics, he discovered counterparts to electrons with negative energy. And in doing so, he opened a portal into a reality much larger than what we used to know at the time. So, spinors are really deep down in the reality and they're responsible for everything that we're seeing right now.

### Graph
In order to see how and what we know about spinors we're going to turn to the Graph. (Edits are suggested by the other EW.)

Edward Witten*

If one wants to summarize our knowledge of physics in the briefest possible terms, there are three really fundamental observations: (i) Spacetime is a pseudo-Riemannina manifold M, endowed with a metric tensor and goverened by geometrical laws. (ii) Over M is a principal G-bundle with a non-abelian structure group G. (iii) Fermions are sections of $$ (\hat{S}_{+} \otimes V_R) \oplus (\hat{S}_{-} \otimes V_{\tilde{R}}) $$. $$ R $$ and $$ \tilde{R} $$ should be (complex) linear representations of G, and so they are not equivalent. The interaction between the Higgs field and the fermionic sections explains why the light fermions are light and presumably has its origins in a representation difference $$ \Delta $$ in some underlying theory. All of this, must be supplemented witht the understanding that the geometrical laws obeyed by the metric tensor, the Higgs field, the gauge fields, and the fermions are to be interpreted in quantum mechanical terms.

### Wall
We've taken the liberty to undertake the iconic Wall at the Stony Brook University, and do some graffiti. By adding the cosmological constant to the Einstein equation at the center of the Wall. And closely related to this topic is the Dirac equation which remains the same as before.

### Tome
In this exposition, the main reference would be the Tome. The book by Sir Roger Penrose, called: The Roead to Reality. It has 34 chapters, but there are about a quarter of them most related to this. Including:
- chapter 10, Surfaces
- chapter 11, Hypercomplex numbers
- chapter 12, Manifolds of n dimensions
- chapter 13, Symmetry groups
- chapter 14, Calculus on manifolds
- chapter 15, Fiber bundles and gauge connections
- chapter 17, Spactime
- chapter 18, Minkowskian geometry
- chapter 27, section 11, Cosmology

### Sir Roger Penrose
Sir Roger Penrose is the prominent figure at the nexus of physics and geometry. He was born in 1931. He did his undergraduate studies in University College London. Then, he went to Cambridge University to do his graduate studies. He got his P.h.D. in algebraic geometry. But a certain question in cosmology regarding the expnsion of the universe motivated him to work on physics problems.

### Hopf fibration
In the standard cosmological models (FLRW,) the universe can be thought of as a 3-surface at each point of cosmological instant of time. Now, if we further assume that the curvature is positive, and we keep out the cosmological constant, then we're going to have a 3-surface as a 3-sphere at each point of time, by keeping time constant. The way that we can visualize a 3-sphere using our visual cortex is to use the Hopf fibration. And also the stereographic projection to bring it down to the Euclidean 3-space that we're familiar with. The picture is inspired by Dror Bar-Natan from the University of Toronto. In the base space, in order to see where you are we've used the geographical map. And at each point of the base space there's a circle. And it's obvious that the circles are linked and this doesn't lead to a trivial bundle. As a 3-surface embedded in a 4-dimensional Euclidean space it has a hole with an interesting topology.

### Paul Dirac
Penrose attended one of Dirac's courses on spinors and quantum field theory. It was absolutely necessary for him to understand 2-component spinors. The way that Sir Roger Penrose explains spinors, it's a setting of a pole and a flag. And through 360 degrees of rotation of the pole the flag changes its sign.In order to get to the initial configuration the settings needs to be rotated 720 degrees. These are natural objects that can be found in the real life.
