# Spinors and the Clutching Construction

$$ \nabla_\boldsymbol{x} J(\boldsymbol{x}) $$

## What's the connection between spinors and the clutching construction?

### Why should we care?
Today, we're going to talk about an important mathematical object: spinors. It's responsible for the stability of matter. Without it, the periodic table wouldn't exist. It determines the properties of atoms in the form of electron shells, and also quarks which make up protons and neutrons.
